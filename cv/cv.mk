## Personal summary



I am a polyglot functional programmer with a background in the philosophy of media and computing.


I have commercial full-stack experience designing and developing distributed web applications written in Haskell, Purescript, Java and TypeScript utilising agile methodologies.


I solve problems involving transformations of data. At the heart of what I do is understanding and communicating the flow, shape, content and consistency of data. I believe the code expressing the transformations should be well-typed, tested, efficient and malleable. 


In my spare time, I like to read a book or learn a new programming language. I have basic competence in Idris, Kotlin, Scala, Rust and WebGL.


## Technical Profile



* Fundamentals of category theory inspired functional programming (Haskell, vavr.io for Java, fp-ts for TypeScript)


* Enterprise level Haskell, Purescript, Java and TypeScript experience


* Experience with big data streaming and processing in google cloud (Pub-Sub, Apache Beam, BigQuery)


* Experience with Docker and Kubernetes microservices in production


* Experience with Continous Integration and Deployment (Bulidkite, Agrocd, GoCD, SonarQube, Ansible)


* Extensive testing experience in backend and frontend (including unit, integration, e2e and property testing)
